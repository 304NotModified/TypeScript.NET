    </h2>

    <p>The intention of this project to to allow for the evolution of a .NET based TypeScript (and resultant JavaScript)
        library.
        Contributions are welcomed as the .NET Library (meaning it's class structure and classes, not necessarily its
        content) has a substantial amount of usefulness. With the open sourcing of .NET, TypeScript seems the most
        logical means to take advantage of it. Typing, generics, classes, modules, inheritance, all are required to make
        a resultant JavaScript library that takes advantage of this elegance.</p>

    <p>Much inspiration comes from TypeScript itself and from libraries like linq.js.
        There is of course some variance away from .NET's convention (camelCase methods in favor of TitleCase) and some
        things simply have to be done different. "Extensions" as a feature might be one of the greatest additions to
        .NET that JavaScript doesn't have a plan for, but it does have some tricky equivalents.</p>

    <p>If you have a .NET Library class that you want to see represented in TypeScript, submit it (as an issue), or
        contribute it yourself! :)</p>

           href="#why-should-i-use-this-let-alone-typescript" aria-hidden="true"><span
                class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should I use this, let alone TypeScript?</h2>

    <p>1) <strong>It's 100% compatible with JavaScript.</strong> Currently TypeScript.NET's target is ES5, so legacy
        JavaScript won't work. Mainly because of accessors. But going forward, TypeScript is nearly the same as ES6 and
        you don't have to change your source code to target newer versions. :) </p>

    <p>2) TypeScript is lead by Anders Hejlsberg, the founder of C#. You will feel quite at home in TypeScript if you
        are a fan of typed languages (like C#), but at the same time you'll get all the flexibility and compatibility of
        JavaScript.</p>

    <p>See <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">http://www.typescriptlang.org/</a> for more information about the
        TypeScript language.</p>

    <p>Also some more good info on Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript</a>.
    </p>

    <p>2) The benefits of intellisense and using an IDE for programming should be obvious especially if you are coding
        for a larger project. Typed compilation is less forgiving in a good way. You simply make much less mistakes in
        the long run. TypeScript might be the best answer to JavaScript yet. It's still JavaScript, but with many
        bonuses including a growing community. :)</p>

    <p>3) Most major IDEs and text editors now support TypeScript either built in, or via a plug-in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio</li>
        <li>VS Code</li>
        <li>WebStorm (strongly recommended!)</li>
        <li>Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Atom</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To name a few.</p>

        <a id="highlights" class="anchor" href="#highlights" aria-hidden="true"><span

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Linq</strong>: Full linq.js library ported to TypeScript with improvements and optimizations. Proper
            use of IEnumerable with passing unit tests. All the things you love about Linq, but fully typed and JS
            compatible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exceptions</strong>: There is a growing set of Exceptions like ArgumentNullException,
            ArgumentOutOfRangeException, etc that are useful in making decisions about how to handle errors using <em>instanceof</em>
            as if you used multiple <em>catch</em> statements in C#.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Collections</strong>: Multiple collections types with standard ICollection and IEnumerable
            interfaces. LinkedList, Queue, Dictionary, and more, all unit tested using a common interface test of
            ICollection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>IDisposable</strong>: Additional interfaces, utilities, and classes like
            <strong>DisposableBase</strong> that help in providing a cleanup pattern for larger applications that may
            easily encounter memory leaks. Many of the classes within, including IEnumerator, use IDisposable to ensure
            releasing of references.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DateTime &amp; TimeSpan</strong>: The <em>System/Time</em> namespace takes these .NET classes and
            goes even further to provide useful classes for calculating and expressing dates and time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    </h1>

    <p>After some time and effort, I've decided that this library should be module based since there are too many files
        and dependencies that may or may not get used. This is simply the right decision and results in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Only loading what you need, when you need it. You can import the entire TypeScript.NET library in your
            project and not worry about extra bytes you don't want.
        </li>
        <li>If you care about bundling and minification <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html"
                                                           target="_blank">r.js optimizer</a> is probably the right way
            to go.
        </li>
        <li>The modular structure is not limited to requirejs since it should work perfectly well with JSPM/SystemJS.
        </li>
        <li>It is easy to change the module types. :)</li>
        <li>You can easily recompile the entire library into another <strong>dist</strong> folder fully minified using
            gulp.
        </li>
        <li>An already minified with source-map version is provided in the <strong>min</strong> folder</li>

    </ul>
