TypeScript.NET AMD/Require.js
=============================

###A work in progress

The current TypeScript compiler does not make it easy to create merged JavaScript files that easily export to a single AMD module.
As I would love this to automatically occur at build time and be minified with a sourcemap, it's currently a manual process.

Herein lies the example configs for using R.js rendered versions.
There may be some quirks with using this method and it is recommended to use the amd-shimmed method instead.
