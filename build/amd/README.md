TypeScript.NET AMD/Require.js
=============================

###A work in progress

The current TypeScript compiler does not make it easy to create merged JavaScript files that easily export to a single AMD module.
As I would love this to automatically occur at build time and be minified with a sourcemap, it's currently a manual process.

Herein lies the example configs for using the full or minified versions.  Currently this uses shims to work as expected.
